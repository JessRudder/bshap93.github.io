title:  "5 Reasons I Chose to Learn Web Development"

There are surely many many reasons I chose to learn web development but here are a few big ones:
<h3>1. Less Spinning my Wheels</h3>
I wanted to do something that was clear cut and logically intensive. Coming from a background in Psychology, I knew I wanted something that was relatively less open to countless iterations of rethinking and having whole new theories with each one. With programming, you're able to build on such iterations. In Psychology, many times that's not the case, but certainly not always.
<h3>2. Building on Your Skills</h3>
Web Development and programming in general can be learned and that learning can be built upon more quickly, or more tangibly than in social sciences. It could take decades to feel like an expert on a social science. Web development takes time to learn, sure, but ultimately, the learning feels more rewarding and that's huge.
<h3>3. Flexibility</h3>
I can easily work remotely, which I have as I have started my learning process, and can see myself continuing to do, at least some of the time. There is simply more flexibility and variety in the work setups for web development than most other professions. You can do it on a bus, at home, or in an office, and it's all largely the same.
<h3>4. It's Very Engaging</h3>
My mind is consumed by the task at hand when I am programming, leaving less opportunity to think, doubt and toil over things in my life that are out of my control. I get engrossed, and I often acheive the much sought after flow state in a way that nothing productive has for me. Other things that can put me in that state, for example, are video games and painting, but I've never been that great at either. Painting is a great hobby, and you can improve incrementally in the same way you do with programming, but it would only ever be a hobby for me.
<h3>5. Online Learning</h3>
I focus best when I learn on my own. Not in a classroom, or in a study group. I would like to be able to do my best work when I'm around others but I simply can't. As I learn online, I'm able to communicate with other learners and developers on my own terms, and in sane doses. This will be something based on which I may have to make some tough decisions when I look for my first job as a web developer, but for anyone wanting to learn and work in a field, it goes without saying, it's very important to consider how you operate best.
