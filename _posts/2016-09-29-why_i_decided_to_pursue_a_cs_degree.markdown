This may be as much a marker for me on my thoughts on this at this time as a traditional blog post. It is personal and not technical.

In the last month or so, I have made the decision to pursue a computer science degree at my current university. I have partitioned my life in a way that would allow me to follow Learn Verified to its conclusion. I wanted to make sure that I would keep on learning long past finishing the curriculum, both in school courses and through online resources like Flatiron post-work and resources like Upcase.  

**Starting Out**

Six months ago today, I truly dove deep into programming. I started with Python, and found Learn Python the Hard Way to be a great guiding resource for someone such as myself being truly new to programming and computer science. I would be quite surprised if six months ago I was told I would be deep into an online coding bootcamp and starting to delve deeper and devote myself into a CS degree. If I can say anything about those six months, I would say it has been hard, but in a great way. I would say perhaps as a result of my near-obsession with pursuing a career as a developer, I have sharpened my mind and honed it in a way that was lacking before.

**Where I am Now**

I have had a rough couple of years health-wise, and in that time, and before that time, truly , I have not known of anything I want to pursue, more than I do now. In the beginning, I certainly wavered while I was learning the basics of programming with regard to whether or not it was for me. However, I would like to think that six months in, as I am now, I know this is what I want to do with my life. No one can really say they know what they will be doing very far into the future. I do know, though, that I'm loving programming every day and I'm loving seeing the improvements in myself. I won't say it's not tough, because it is. Whether in the context of a technical problem, or getting turned down for a position you really wanted and your family wanted for you after successfully completing their very difficult programming challenge, it's tough, and a computer science degree, while maybe not the hardest, will personally, for me, challenge my brain and my grit. 

I think one big reason why anybody pursues anything as their career has to be that they are good at it. I feel that computer science takes advantage of my aptitudes in math and at reasoning and thinking. I know it will be a ton of work, and I'm not a prodigy, but I believe in my natural abilities and work ethic. It may be an uncommon path, but for me, it started with a structured experience of being a beginner, and then getting serious about programming and taking a leap in enrolling with Learn Verified. For many it may be reversed, but I got my start in a bootcamp-esque setting online, and then decided that within the university I was already enrolled, I wanted to go all the way and attain a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. However, I didn't start and only recently would be able to tell you I was sure I want to do this. I first planned to minor in CS, and then with a degree in three minors, I considered minoring in math as well since the CS and math courses go together.

**An Amazing, Exciting, and Welcoming Community**

Another reason I wanted to be a CS major was the community at my particular University being a tightly knit group and of course, exciting to be around and be able to talk tech and even help out some other students in my courses. Like I said, I have dove deep and so I haven't had quite as consistent a blog and my pace with Learn Verified has slowed some. Still, having an outlet to keep learning in Flatiron, when the schoolwork gets slow, is a great way for me to stay busy and feel like I am moving steadily toward my goals. 

In some ways, I have had to spread myself more thin than I would ideally be spread, since I'm using Ruby and Rails for one of my major curriculums and trying to learn C++ and Java for CS, and I'd like to soon put Javascript into that mix. There is truly an endless amount of things learn, and it's not all going to come right away, but I feel confident that I'm in a good place and on a good path, and that something will come of this hard work. It has been hard being a beginner and I can't wait to be more experienced, but as other developers have said, being a beginner can also be a great thing, and as a developer, you're always a beginner in something.
