For the aspiring developer, everywhere you hear that hackathons are amazing, fun, challenging and essentially one of the best ways to meet amazing people and network. Three weeks ago, I had never been to a hackathon, but was planning on going to two in the next two consecutive weekends. I was worried, having been told by my doctor that he had bipolar patients become highly manic after staying awake for the 24 hours of a hackathon.

Well, I thought, I could just bring a sleeping mat and a sleeping bag and find somewhere quiet to get my sleep in. It seemed like a great plan. However, sleeping in an uncertain place can be anxiety provoking, especially if you are predisposed to anxiety and insomnia. Ultimately, I ended up taking my meds but unable to sleep and having to take an Uber back home. Though I planned on coming back in the morning, and I did so, I still felt I had abandoned my team. I felt I could have helped my team do better than we did if I had stayed. But of course my health came first and it should for you too. Understandably, hackathon organizers aren't there yet with making being competitive at the central competition of the hackathon accessible to a great diversity of people with differing mental and physical health concerns.

So for the hackathon the next weekend, I planned on leaving to sleep at my apartment. I felt that I shouldn't join a team because I would feel like I let them down again. I did join a team, and I did go home to sleep, and we ended up winning a drone for winning the particular challenge we had taken on. Of course, I felt like I wasn't really part of the team but again, I wasn't sorry. However, participating can be a great experience for anyone regardless if you accommodate correctly for your particular situation.

So, for people with mental health concerns, and especially bipolar disorder, or any condition that requires quality sleep for well being: know yourself and know that you can go to and benefit from a hackathon and you don't have to sacrifice your stability. I learned a shit ton in even the reduced hours I attended.
