As I wrap up the main track of Learn.co, and look to the next semester of university, I'm wondering how having completed this program will affect me going forward. I feel that at this point I'm just beginning to have a holistic view of web development, as I finish up the Rails and Javascript section and I'm able to see how the back end and front end go together. As this is happening, I'm realizing just how much I have still to learn, but I'm starting to have a better handle on the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails developement. I'm about to dive into the intricacies of computer science with non-introductory courses in university and I wonder how I will fare in that. 

I just have to be cognizant of my limits and be willing to slow down a bit if it gets to be too much, though I would like to be able to do more than I know I can. People surrounding me say all the time now that I'm doing so well now that it seems to other people that I have direction, and I wonder and doubt. I don't know where my journey will take me, and I'm only slightly and cautionsly optimistic, as it seems that at times it's the same as it ever was, but just maybe, if I keep doing the "right" things, things will just fine.
