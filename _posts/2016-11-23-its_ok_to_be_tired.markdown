Sometimes you're tired of working and studying to be a developer. A huge number people deal with depression and anxiety and other mental health issues and for many of these people tired is a well known sentiment. When you're caught up spending every moment possible learning, working because you're trying to be good enough, it can be tiring. 

This [video by Greg Baugues](https://vimeo.com/78419167) talking about mental health in software development in general and his experience with bipolar disorder and ADHD made me think about how we need to talk about this kind of thing more. I relate very much to him, as I have bipolar disorder and have thought I have ADHD, but anyone can relate on some level to this. 

We're afraid to talk about it because we think others will judge us to be broken or unemployable. But it's this reluctance to talk openly about the problems that we are ashamed to have that give them power. Let's not let something manageable with treatment or support take the wheel and make our lives small if it doesn't have to.

I look forward to hearing from Mr. Bauges and his [Developers and Depression](http://devsanddepression.com/) newsletter, and I look forward to and hope that my being more open will create a space for people to talk about being tired, or ashamed, or in pain. 

In Ruby, we hear the idea of MINSWAN (Matz is happy so we are happy) and as Rubyists, you could say we carry the torch of happiness. But happiness is only part of the equation, and if we can only express ourselves when it's an expression of happiness, then we are missing each other. Let's talk about it. It's ok to be tired.
