title:  "Why Anyone Learning Programming Should Publish a Site Early On"

Anyone learning programming, especially web development is probably starting with at least HTML, CSS and quite possibly Javascript early on. What I'm proposing is something you can do to boost your confidence early on as you learn and develop your skills. The key is to have complete control over your site.

> Control over your code and your domain is key

One of the mistakes I made early on was to use Wordpress to publish my site. Unless you're learning to build Wordpress themes with PHP, this is not the way to go if you want to feel confident and in control of your first site. If you're new to programming as I was and still am, starting from scratch is way too hard, and using a premade theme doesn't give you the control you should feel you want as a programmer.

> Start With a Static Site

Getting up and running with your HTML, CSS and Javascript is easy with Github Pages. Make something simple, like a profile or portfolio page. Don't worry if you don't have too many projects to show off yet. Github pages makes it super easy to update your content and add bells and whistles as you learn. If you're feeling ambitious, try to [hook up your site to a blog with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).  Just follow their [starting out guide ](https://pages.github.com/) and if you're not that familiar yet with HTML and CSS, try downloading a Bootstrap template and making as many changes as you can. I promise you'll learn something.

> Buy a Domain Name

It's great to have your code viewable from your username.github.io domain but if you can afford it, I highly recommend buying a domain name. You will feel like your site is totally yours, because you named it. [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com) is cheap and easy to connect to your Github pages site. They even have a [guide](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages) to walk you through step by step to connect your site to your domain. Again, since you're using GH pages, there's no need to pay for web hosting. Just buy a domain name.

> Show it Off

It's like writing your first Hello World program except it's there at the fingertips of everyone on earth. Again, I waited too long to make my first site. I recommend doing it after the first month of learning to code.
